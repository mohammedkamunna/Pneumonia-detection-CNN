pneumonia classification using cnn model 

using chest X-Ray data set from kaggle to train it on a convolutional neural network. We build our model from scratch. And we have reached a model that is given a chest X-Ray image can classify whether this chest is infected with pneumonia or it is normal. And the model accuracy is 92 % on the test set.

main stages explained in the provided ppt poster.
